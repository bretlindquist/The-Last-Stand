# The Last Stand

*What started out as a simple assignment, turned into an impossible mission to save the human race from complete destruction.* 

As the player attempted to finish his homework, he realized a battle was being waged on planet Earth. Things had come alive, magical beasts were roaming through the streets, and entities, real or imagined, began wiping out the human race. Armed with nothing but guts and a little logic, he began slaying the beasts one by one. Finally, exhausted and fatigued from countless battles, he stood on a hill overlooking the remaining horde approaching.

## Enter into Epic Battles

**Enter into epic battles to save the human race as you defeat hordes of monsters with little bit your blood, sweat, and determination.** Survival may be slim, but that isn't stopping you from cutting down foe after foe.

### Fate is in Your Hands

Each time you run the game, you run the risk of losing it all or saving the human race. 

Take fate into your own hands with *The Last Stand*.
